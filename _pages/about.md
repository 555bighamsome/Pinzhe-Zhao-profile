Hello — I'm Pinzhe Zhao, a third-year undergraduate student in Cognitive Science at the University of Edinburgh. I'm interested in computational cognitive science, machine learning, and explainable AI. I enjoy building models that help explain human cognition and developing interpretable ML systems.

Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub: [555bighamsome](https://github.com/555bighamsome) or connect with me on LinkedIn: [zach-zhao-b4a0802a0](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-zhao-b4a0802a0/).
